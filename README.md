# Hospitalization-prediction
Predicting hospitalization for Dialysis patients

## Motivation and Context
* End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) - impacts over 780,000 Americans
* 50% mortality rate
* Over 98% of newly diagnosed ESRD patients begin dialysis.
* Given the high cost of care and poor outcomes, ESRD has become one of the central focuses of value-based payment models.
* The Quality Incentive Program (QIP) program penalizes reimbursement rates for facilities with poor quality metrics, with penalties applied in increments of 0.05% up to a maximum of 2%.
* Standard Hospitalization Ratio (SHR) and Standard Readmission Ratio (SRR) are two major components of the ESRD QIP program.
* We aim to classify which facilities are likely to have a worse than expected SHR or SRR utilizing features derived from metrics that dialysis centers can measure within the facility.

## Dataset 
* We use two datasets:
1. Quality Incentive Program (QIP) dataset for the payment year 2021 with clinical data from 2019.
2. Facilities dataset which comprises general measures about the dialysis facility that CMS collects.

* The datasets consist of the following type of features:
1. Clinical measures
2. Structural measures
3. Patient experience measures
